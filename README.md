# üìß Spam Classification

This project is focused on classifying emails into spam or ham categories using machine learning techniques. The project implements two text vectorization methods: Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). Additionally, text preprocessing techniques like stemming and lemmatization are applied to improve the classification accuracy. The accuracies of different approaches are compared to find the best method for spam classification.

### Key Features:
- **Text Vectorization**: Implements Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF for converting text data into numerical features.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Includes stemming and lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.
- **Model Comparison**: Compares classification accuracy between BoW and TF-IDF with and without stemming and lemmatization.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implements classification algorithms like Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
